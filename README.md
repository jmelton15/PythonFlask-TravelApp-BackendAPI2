## Getting Started

<!-- DATA STORAGE AND SAFETY -->
## Authorization and Authentication

All routes are setup for authorization using JWT (json web tokens) 
Still working on finishing some routes as well as validators for form data and request data

## Data Storage And Safety

Everything that is stored to be used later is encrypted and secured while stored. This includes anything from password,email,travel forms, to all the locations from your trips. Decoding alogorithms are in places to bring back the stored data to be used
on the client side when asked by that specific user. I may have went a little overboard with the encryption even, but it was fun to learn and good practice! However, I may get rid of the encrypting of the locations from trips as that takes time and may not be needed since registered users can see these anyways.
